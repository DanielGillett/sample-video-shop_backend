npm i winston

The winston you get is the default logger that is exported 
from the require('winston') module.

using the default logger is sufficient for small to 
medium-sized applications.

You may need to custom logger only if you're  building a 
really large, complex application; and you want to have 
different loggers that behave differently in different 
parts of the application.

This require('winston') logger object has what is called
a 'transport'.  ..a storage device for a logs.

Winston comes with a few core transports:
console
file
http

There are also pluggins for winston.  there are other npm
modules for logging messages in:
mongoDB
couchDB
Redis
Loggly - which is a very popular log analysis and monitoring
             service for enterprise applications.

The default winston comes with 1 transport that is for 
logging messages on the console.

Here, in this lesson, we are going to create another 
transport for logging messages in a file...

// winston needs more study.  We're using a different version of Winston 
// which seems to have more involved methods setting it up corretly.
